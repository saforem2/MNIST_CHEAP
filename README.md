# MNIST_CHEAP
Simple neural network for classifying MNIST data

NOTE: Before running this program, you must first download the data, using the
get_mnist_data.sh script located in the DATA directory.

Once the data has been downloaded, you can run the program either via the main.py program, or through the MNIST_neural_net.ipynb ipython notebook, which has a couple additional features such as the ability to run the network on a single image, and a visualization of the learned weights.
